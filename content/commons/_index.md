# The Commons

The commons has long played a historical role in making cultural and natural resources accessible to all members of a society. 

Creative Commons is part of that long tradition complementing the historical local and natural resource based commons with a contemporary global digital commons. Understanding the commons and how it works is essential to successfully using Creative Commons.
