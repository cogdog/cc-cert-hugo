Imagine a time in the new future in which all writing can be commercialized. 

## The Big Question

Through the magic of a new technology which can automatically capture and upload them to a website, every napkin doodle, every journal entry, and every love letter can be made available for sale as soon as you finish writing them. By means of improvements to operating systems like Windows, Mac, and Linux, all written documents like emails, homework assignments, and office memos can be automatically posted for sale on the site as soon as they are saved. 

An upgrade to the technology might help users automatically offer all images they create for sale, from mobile phone photos to crayon drawings to watercolor paintings. Future versions of the technology might provide the same functionality for videos and sound recordings.

Now imagine that when this final version of the software is released, the national government requires all citizens to install it on all their devices, mandating the commercialization of every creative work that will ever be produced in the future, regardless of how trivial - or personal - it is. 


**There are a thousand things wrong with this scenario**. And while the technology sounds fantastic and distant, the legal foundation of this dystopian future is already in place. After joining the [Berne Convention](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention), most countries in the world now automatically apply copyright - the legal protections necessary to effectively commercialize a creative work - to each and every creative work the moment it is created, regardless of how personal or trivial it is. In this worldview that anticipates the commercialization of all creative works, a three year old child’s wobbly pencil drawing is protected to the same degree as Star Wars or Harry Potter. And this is not a hypothetical future scenario, it’s the actual state of affairs in the world today. 


This situation is utterly preposterous for many reasons, but one important reason is that many people create things with the goal of sharing them with others, like directions for purifying water after a natural disaster. What if a creator doesn’t want their work “protected” from copying and distribution, but wants it copied and shared as far and wide as technologically possible?   


Return to our imaginary scenario for a moment. 

What if, recognizing the public backlash, a second technology company created a tool that allowed a person to remove things from the website that commercialized all creative work? While it wouldn’t be able to prevent things from being placed on the site for sale automatically (as the law required), it would provide people with an easy - and legal - way to remove things from the site that they didn’t want to commercialize.


Returning to the real world, this is essentially what an open license does. Open licenses are easy to use legal tools - copyright licenses - that allow people to choose to share their work with others under a range of conditions. Rather than being forced to accept the default All Rights Reserved “protection” the law automatically forces on each and every creative work, a creator or author can choose to apply an open license license to their work, thereby allowing it to be copied and shared widely and legally. Many open licenses also grant permission to make changes and improvements to the work, like translating the document about purifying water into other languages. By applying an open license to their creation, an author places that work in a broader commons of creative works.

## Learning Outcomes
* Dramatize problem open licensing is solving/addressing, how it is an alternative to copyright
* Illustrate where open licensing exists on spectrum between public domain & copyright
* Explain potentials, uses of open licensing, value of sharing as a default
* Analyze the reasons for open licensing in your context
* Define opportunities / benefits of collaborative peer production
* Demonstrate benefits of access to knowledge


## Opening Questions

Should all writing, images, videos, sound recordings, and other creative works be automatically protected by copyright so they can be commercialized? Think of all the things you create every day - emails, photos, videos, and more. You may have authored a million or more creative works over your lifetime. Even if you are a creative professional and earn your livelihood by selling creative works, over 99.999% of what you have created has rightly gone uncommercialized. What might be the benefit of sharing some of these works with colleagues, peers, other organizations, or “the community”? How might your work be improved upon if you gave others permission to make improvements?

## Your Quest: Taking on the Big Question

Blah blah blah

Answer by completing this CC Quest:

**What's the Opportunity of the Commons?**

Select a resource that you have created. Along with sharing the resource, share an evaluation of the opportunities and benefits that could come from sharing this resource with peers (reach, critique, collaborative peer production).

Share a resource you own the copyright for and make a call for collaborative peer production/improvement of the material. 

Find a resource and locate the copyright on the resource. Share the steps it would take to contact the copyright holder to use their work. This will help demonstrate an understanding of how much easier it is to use and share a CC licensed work.
