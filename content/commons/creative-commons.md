What if there was a means for creators to express willingness to share their knowledge and creative works? A simple and standardized way creators could use to give the public permission to use their work under certain conditions?

## The Big Question

What if we combined that means with the power of the Internet and digital technology making it possible to share resources globally for the near marginal cost of $0?

[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org) does this very thing. Created as a US non-profit in 2002 and now with a global network, Creative Commons provides legal and technical infrastructure that helps creators legally share their knowledge and creativity to build a more equitable, accessible, and innovative world. Creative Commons licenses and digital tools, combined with the Internet, are driving new forms of development, growth and productivity.

## Learning Outcomes
* Explain why Creative Commons is necessary as an organization, mission & vision, goals
* Evaluate impact of Creative Commons, examples of program work, where it is used
* Identify major initiatives, programs
* Explain, demonstrate Creative Commons resources and materials (including License Chooser, FAQ, and wiki)

* Explain how to get involved, communicate with Creative Commons

## Personal Reflection / Why it Matters To You 

If you could freely access creative works what kinds of works would you seek? Books, music, film, cultural works? Research, education, data? What creative works do you or your organization have that have potential value to others? How might sharing those resources with others benefit you and the public?

## Application of Learning
CC Certificates aim to engage you in direct application of learning for personal and / or professional use. Toward that end the following learning activities aim to help you you use and apply basic knowledge in ways directly relevant to you. Learning activities are structured around 1. Creation of a personal learner toolkit. 2 Active participation in CC’s community, and 3. Applied practice.


### Learner Toolkit
Select at least 2 or 3 resources directly relevant to your personal or work related CC needs from the Acquiring Basic Knowledge content and add them to your personal Creative Commons toolkit. Adding them to your toolkit makes it easy to find and use them when the need arises and makes it easy for you to pass on resources you consider important to others. Add comments explaining relevancy and importance.


### Community - Collaboration, Appreciation, Recognition, Gratitude
In the CC Certificate social forum post your answers to the personal reflection questions posed at the start of this learning unit. Identify and comment on posts from at least two others who have similar needs or ideas.


Sign up for at least two means of connecting with Creative Commons such as following on Twitter, joining mailing lists of interest, subscribing to the Creative Commons newsletter, and joining the Creative Commons Slack channel.

From the [Creative Commons news blog](https://creativecommons.org/blog/), [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/creativecommons), [Twitter stream](https://twitter.com/creativecommons) and [web pages](https://creativecommons.org/) identify at least two other people or organizations who are using Creative Commons in a similar way you or your organization do or want to do. Note these people or organizations in your Toolkit along with questions you might have for them in concerning advice or lessons learned.


### Applied Practice
The [Creative Commons Share Your Work](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/) page lists a number of platforms like Wikipedia, Flickr, and Vimeo that provide their users with the option of licensing works with Creative Commons licenses. 

Using the links to the platforms on the [Share Your Work](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/) page or the [Creative Commons Search tool](http://search.creativecommons.org/) find and list in your Toolkit two or three resources that are representative of the kinds of creative works you said you would seek in Personal Reflections. Document the name of the resource, its url, identity of the creator, and Creative Commons license used. Make a comment beside each on how you might make use of it.

Complete the following activity in the Quest Bank.

* [Explain What Creative Commons Is](https://quests.creativecommons.org/assignments/explain-what-creative-commons-is)  

**Bonus applied practice:** Join Creative Commons global network. (note this activity will be relevant once the new global network strategy of CC is deployed.)
