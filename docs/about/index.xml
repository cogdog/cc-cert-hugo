&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://flic.kr/p/6wYoR8&#34;&gt;Most Magnetized Object in the Universe&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc/&#34;&gt;NASA Goddard Space Flight Center&lt;/a&gt; licensed under &lt;a href=&#34;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&#34;&gt;CC BY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-needed&#34;&gt;Why Needed?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its launch in 2001 use of Creative Commons around the world has grown dramatically to the point where in 2015 there were over 1 billion Creative Commons licensed works. Writers, photographers, musicians and other creators use Creative Commons to share works and gain an audience. Cultural organizations including galleries, libraries, archives, and museums use Creative Commons to make their collections accessible to all. Use has broadened out further to include Open Educational Resources, Open Access research publishing, open data, and open science. Governments, non-profit organizations, and businesses around the world are adopting open policies and open strategies that use Creative Commons and the Internet to share and distribute resources to drive a new era of development, growth, and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this growth comes a corresponding need to ensure creators, staff, and organizations have a thorough working knowledge of what Creative Commons is and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Creative Commons CORE certificate covers the full breadth and depth of learning associated with acquiring comprehensive knowledge about all aspects of Creative Commons. CORE covers a composite set of knowledge and skills associated with responsibilities across multiple roles including practitioners, administrators, and leaders. In addition to being its own standalone certificate, CORE is foundational curricula from which specialized Creative Commons certificates are built. Creative Commons certificates for librarians, educators, and government start with a subset of CORE as foundation, on top of which specialized learning is added specific to how each profession uses Creative Commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://creativecommons.github.io/cc-cert-core/images/Foundations.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Foundations&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://flic.kr/p/8Tbb1W&#34;&gt;Foundations&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/sapheron/&#34;&gt;Gregory Bodnar&lt;/a&gt; is licensed &lt;a href=&#34;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/&#34;&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-is-this-for&#34;&gt;Who is this for?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Creative Commons CORE Certificate is for those who need deep and comprehensive knowledge of Creative Commons including individuals and organizations wanting to become authorized to deliver Creative Commons certificate training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-skills-and-knowledge-will-you-gain&#34;&gt;What skills and knowledge will you gain?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On completion of the certificate you will be able to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;explain relationship of Creative Commons to the public domain, copyright, and the commons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;state the benefits of Creative Commons licenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;effectively use Creative Commons to make resources open and shareable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find and use Creative Commons licensed resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;advise on strategic use of Creative Commons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide Creative Commons related training and support services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plan and advocate for institutional systematic changes towards openness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creative Commons Certificates have been created with the kind support of &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/&#34;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imls.gov/&#34;&gt;Institute of Museum and Library Services&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gatesfoundation.org/&#34;&gt;Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://creativecommons.github.io/cc-cert-core/images/light.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;light&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://unsplash.com/collections/400956/play?photo=uf4oyaimWwg&#34;&gt;Photo&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://unsplash.com/@jamomca&#34;&gt;Jamison McAndie&lt;/a&gt; has been placed in the Public Domain using &lt;a href=&#34;https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&#34;&gt;CC0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivery of formal certificate training is done by Creative Commons and its authorized partners. Authorized partners include institutions and organizations who have gone through a “train-the-trainer” process with Creative Commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons uses a “flipped classroom” approach for formal delivery of the CC CORE Certificate. The flipped classroom is a pedagogical model in which the typical lecture and homework elements of a course are reversed. The CC CORE Certificate starts with everyone having access to the online CORE curricula and learning activities. Participants complete the learning modules and activities in advance of a live facilitated portion of the delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a significant number of participants complete the online learning Creative Commons facilitators schedules a 2 day in person or online facilitated session. Using the flipped classroom approach the live facilitated component of delivery focuses on helping participants generate evidence of learning completion, demonstrate mastery by completing a final assignment for each module, and learn from each other through shared learning activities and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon successful completion of the online learning and the 2 day facilitated learning activities participating participants will be invited to assemble and submit evidence of learning to claim their certification. Evidence will be comprised of a personal toolkit, community engagement, applied practice portfolio, and culminating module mastery learning outputs. Submitted evidence will be reviewed by CC certificate facilitators to ensure successful completion of learning outcomes. On confirmation of completion a Creative Commons certificate will be awarded and recipients listed publicly on Creative Commons web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;duration&#34;&gt;Duration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons recommends budgeting 3-4 days of effort to complete the online learning work in advance of the 2 day live facilitated face-to-face session. All told completion of the certificate will take 5 to 6 days (40-50 hours of effort).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer or tablet device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to the Internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willingness to collaborate with peers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Openness to engage in social community activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confidence in sharing examples of completed work openly on the web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;learning-process&#34;&gt;Learning Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The certificate learning process involves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consideration of a big question that situates the learning in a big picture context and helps you see its importance and why it matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal reflection that makes the topic specifically relevant to your personal life or work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquiring essential knowledge through readings, audio, and videos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application of learning through creation of a toolkit, engaging in the Creative Commons community, and applied practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrating mastery by contributing to the public commons in a way that generates value for yourself and others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;certification&#34;&gt;Certification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon successful completion of learning activities, confirmed by review of evidence, a Creative Commons certificate will be awarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certificate recipients will be listed publicly on Creative Commons web site in a means that is verifiable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You claim certification by submitting your personal toolkit, evidence of community engagement, applied practice portfolio and culminating module mastery learning outputs. Your submitted evidence will be reviewed by CC certificate facilitators to ensure successful completion of learning outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claiming certification and the ensuing review of evidence will require payment of a fee that helps recover costs associated with offering and maintaining the certificate program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Fee payment is necessary for cost recovery reasons. We acknowledge some participants may not be able to pay a fee. We don’t want fees to be a barrier so Creative Commons offers alternatives to fee payment which may include things like authoring additional content for a learning unit, or maintaining a learning unit that has linkrot/holes, enhancing units with visuals, translating content, localizing content, mentoring others, etc. Contact CC when you are ready to claim your certificate for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-forms-of-participation-and-delivery-options&#34;&gt;Other forms of participation and delivery options&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-cert-lib/blob/master/images/ReadOn.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Read On&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://flic.kr/p/8CBVH2&#34;&gt;Read On!&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/vblibrary/&#34;&gt;Enokson&lt;/a&gt; is licensed &lt;a href=&#34;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&#34;&gt;CC BY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CC certificates have been authored in a way that is independent of delivery mode. Participation can be done in a 100% online mode of delivery, a mixed/hybrid (partly online / partly face-to-face), or a completely in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certificate participation can be informal (no certificate sought) or formal (certificate sought), scheduled or unscheduled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flexible delivery and participation options include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Informal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scheduled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unscheduled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn for free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certification for a fee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DIY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;unscheduled-informal&#34;&gt;Unscheduled Informal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons certificate content and learning activities are available online at all times for your use. You can come and go as you please and engage in learning over whatever time period you choose. Unscheduled informal learning is free, no registration or payment is required. Unscheduled learning does not have a facilitator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;unscheduled-formal&#34;&gt;Unscheduled Formal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may start out simply learning about Creative Commons in an unscheduled informal way but at some point if you decide you want to seek certification you can flip to formal. Flipping to formal requires you to complete the learning activities and claim your certificate by submitting evidence of completion. (See descriptions of formal below.) A fee will be required for review of evidence and award of certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;scheduled-informal&#34;&gt;Scheduled Informal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On request Creative Commons will provide informal delivery to groups of individuals from the same organization over a scheduled period of days. Scheduled delivery will be led by facilitators and be fee based. Delivery can be online, hybrid, or face-to-face depending on needs. Scheduled informal delivery focuses on engaging participants in acquiring basic knowledge through learning activities relevant to their work. Completion of all learning activities and submission of evidence of completion is not required. No formal certificate will be issued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;scheduled-formal&#34;&gt;Scheduled Formal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On request Creative Commons will provide formal delivery to groups of individuals from the same organization over a scheduled period of days. Scheduled delivery will be led by facilitators and be fee based. Delivery can be online, hybrid, or face-to-face depending on needs. Scheduled formal delivery focuses on an initial online phase engaging participants in acquiring basic knowledge and learning activities relevant to their work. After successful completion of the online learning a 2 day face to face or online facilitated delivery is scheduled. Completion of learning activities and submission of evidence is required before qualifying to receive the formal certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;custom&#34;&gt;Custom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special customized training programs can be prepared on request. Contact CC to enquire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;diy&#34;&gt;DIY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons certificates have been authored as Open Educational Resources (OER). The content is available to organizations to reuse and remix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a technical perspective the content has been produced in the simplest yet most transportable structural format of Markdown. The “master” copies &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-cert-lib&#34;&gt;live on Github&lt;/a&gt; where Creative Commons can manage and track all versions in one place. Use of GitHub to manage source files makes it possible for anyone to create their own “fork” of that content in Github and add or modify certificate learning materials to fit organizational specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Markdown content can be migrated to other environments, with a few transformations for links and images to work. However Creative Commons can provide a fully-self contained version in Wordpress format, that can be imported to any theme. With a custom plugin, the certification content will work out of the box, and all localizations can be done in more familiar Wordpress environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Creative Commons will be able to  a forkable self contained version as static HTML as well as Gitbooks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to give you multiple ways to DIY customize your own version of CC certificates. If in the process of customization you produce new content you think we should add to the master version you can submit edits back to us via the GitHub fork and push process. DIY versions of certificate training can be created and delivered by anyone but participants will not receive formal certificates from Creative Commons.&lt;/p&gt;
