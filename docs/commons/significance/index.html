<p>What do Wikipedia and medieval English pasture lands have in common? (Hint: the answer is right there in the question.) And why should you care?</p>

<h2 id="the-big-question">The Big Question</h2>

<p>Both Wikipedia and medieval English pasture lands are examples of a Commons. <a href="http://bollier.org/commons-short-and-sweet">As economist David Bollier describes it</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>a Commons arises whenever a given community decides it wishes to manage a resource in a collective manner, with special regard for equitable access, use and sustainability”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Commons are everywhere - from modern web communities to ancient agrarian communities - and understanding what they are and how they function is key to understanding the world around us.</p>

<p>You probably participate in one or more Commons yourself - and by the time you finish this module you’ll be able to recognize a Commons you are part of, describe what makes it a Commons, and identify potential threats to the sustainability of your Commons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am always trying to figure out how to explain the idea of the commons to newcomers who find it hard to grasp.  In preparation for a talk that I gave at the Caux Forum for Human Security, near Montreux, Switzerland, I came up with a fairly short overview, which I have copied below.  I think it gets to the nub of things.</p>

<p>The commons is….</p>

<ul>
<li>A social system for the long-term stewardship of resources that preserves shared values and community identity.</li>
<li>A self-organized system by which communities manage resources (both depletable and and replenishable) with minimal or no reliance on the Market or State.</li>
<li>The wealth that we inherit or create together and must pass on, undiminished or enhanced, to our children.  Our collective wealth includes the gifts of nature, civic infrastructure, cultural works and traditions, and knowledge.</li>
<li>A sector of the economy (and life!) that generates value in ways that are often taken for granted – and often jeopardized by the Market-State.</li>

<h2 id="why-is-the-commons-important">Why is the Commons Important?</h2>

<p>Now that we understand the Commons, let’s talk a little bit about why the commons is important.</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://www.benkler.org/Upgrade-Novatica%20Commons.pdf">The Political Economy of Commons</a> a published paper in UPGRADE (European Journal for the
Informatics Professional) PDF by  <a href="http://benkler.org">Yochai Benkler</a> licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC-BY</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why Commons?</p>

<p>Commons are institutional spaces, in which we can practice a particular type of freedom – freedom from the constraints we normally accept as necessary preconditions to functional markets.</p>

<ul>
<li>Though we often think of ‘free markets’ as spaces that enable free choice, in fact these are structured relationships intended to elicit a particular datum – the comparative willingness and ability of agents to pay money for resource.</li>

<li><p>The most important constraints under-girding markets are those we usually call property. Property is a cluster of background rules that determine</p>

<ul>
<li>what resources each of us has when we come into relations with others</li>
<li>what ‘having’ or ‘lacking’ a resource allows us to do or refuse to do in relations surrounding resources. These rules impose constraints on who can do what in the domain of actions that require access to resources that are the subjects of property law.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>While a necessary precondition for markets, property law means that choice in markets is itself not free of constraints, but is instead constrained in a particular pattern</p></li>

<li><p>Commons are institutional spaces where human agents can act free of the particular constraints required for markets.</p></li>

<li><p>This does not mean that commons are anarchic spaces. Purely free action is illusory.</p></li>

<li><p>It means that individuals and groups can use resources governed under different types of constraints than those imposed by property law. These constraints may be social, or physical, or regulatory. They may make individuals more or less free, in some aggregate sense, than do property rules. Whether a commons in fact enhances freedom or harms it then, depends on how the commons is structured, and on how property rights in the resource would have been structured in the absence of a commons.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Like the idea of The Commons, the process of enclosure came too from the history of land ownership in England. Explore it&rsquo;s history and ongoing occurrence from the definition in Wikipedia.</p>

<p><a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure">Enclosure</a> is a Wikipedia entry licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC-BY-SA</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Enclosure (sometimes inclosure) was the legal process in England during the 18th century of enclosing a number of small landholdings to create one larger farm.  Once enclosed, use of the land became restricted to the owner, and it ceased to be common land for communal use. In England and Wales the term is also used for the process that ended the ancient system of arable farming in open fields. Under enclosure, such land is fenced (enclosed) and deeded or entitled to one or more owners. The process of enclosure began to be a widespread feature of the English agricultural landscape during the 16th century. By the 19th century, unenclosed commons had become largely restricted to rough pasture in mountainous areas and to relatively small parts of the lowlands.</p>

<p>Enclosure could be accomplished by buying the ground rights and all common rights to accomplish exclusive rights of use, which increased the value of the land. The other method was by passing laws causing or forcing enclosure, such as Parliamentary enclosure. The latter process of enclosure was sometimes accompanied by force, resistance, and bloodshed, and remains among the most controversial areas of agricultural and economic history in England. Marxist and neo-Marxist historians argue that rich landowners used their control of state processes to appropriate public land for their private benefit.</p>

<p>To further understand enclosure as a concept, let’s take a look at the effects of enclosure upon the Commons. Listen to the audio at 5:00-7:47 from David Bollier&rsquo;s podcast <a href="http://bollier.org/week-4-history-commons-and-enclosure">Week 4: The History of Commons and Enclosure</a> for his  &ldquo;The Commons Rising&rdquo; course he taught at Amherst College in the Spring 2010 semester.</p>

<p>Read about the sustainability of the commons under the section 3 &ldquo;Are Commons Sustainable?&rdquo; from Yochai Benkler&rsquo;s <em>The Political Economy of Commons</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.benkler.org/Upgrade-Novatica%20Commons.pdf">The Political Economy of Commons</a> a published paper in UPGRADE (European Journal for the Informatics Professional) PDF by  <a href="http://benkler.org">Yochai Benkler</a> licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC-BY</a> starting on page 7</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the late 1960s Garrett Hardin coined an immensely effective trope, <em>“the tragedy of the commons.”</em> Originally aimed to explain why private incentives would lead to firms to pollute their environment even against their own long term interest, and thereby to justify pollution controls, the trope took on a life of its own. It came to stand for a proposition that all commons are tragic, and that property rights are a necessary precondition to efficient, or even sustainable, resource management. Over the past twenty years or so, we have seen the development of a literature that challenges this now-standard understanding of commons. Most crisply this effort has come to be crystallized in the work of Eleanor Ostrom. A recent review and bibliographic essay by Hess and Ostrom provides an excellent overview of this literature. The crux of most of this work is that there are certain circumstances under which common property regimes are sustainable, and quite possibly more efficient than individual property regimes.</p>

<p>While very popular as a phrase, many have criticized &ldquo;the tragedy of the commons&rdquo; most notably Ian Angus, editor of Climate and Capitalism. In 2008 he published <a href="http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2008/angus250808.html">The Myth of the Tragedy of the Commons</a> in the <em>Monthly Review.</em></p>

<p>As summarized in  <a href="http://www.onthecommons.org/debunking-tragedy-commons">Debunking the Tragedy of the Commons</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Angus notes that Hardin offers no empirical evidence that herders actually overgraze their cattle on shared plots of land, let alone that this is the general rule for shared resources. He also notes that Hardin provides no evidence that private ownership necessarily manages a resource more responsibly; indeed, the “tragedy of the market” is a well-documented phenomenon. Angus also reviews briefly the political usefulness of the tragedy thesis, and its continued misuse in contemporary economics and policy.</p>

<h2 id="your-quest-taking-on-the-big-question">Your Quest: Taking on the Big Question</h2>

<p>We’re all familiar with the ideas of markets and governments, but we tend to be less familiar with the idea of a Commons.</p>

<p>However, once you understand what a Commons is and how it works you begin to see that they’re all around you - from online communities that develop open source software or open content to face to face communities that manage community gardens or bike co-ops. Commoning is a powerful, proven strategy for coming together to managing resources in a way that ensures that members of the community will continue to have access to the resources - without resorting to the potential abuses of markets and inefficiencies of governments.</p>

<p>Answer by completing this CC Quest:</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Your Commons?</strong></p>

<p>Identify a Commons you participate in and briefly describe the nature of the resources shared in that Commons, some of the people who participate in that Commons, and some of the community’s norms about how to create, manage, and sustain the resources in that Commons. How do you benefit from your participation in that Commons? What do you contribute to that Commons? <a href="http://quests.creativecommons.org/">Complete this Quest</a> (link to be added).</p>
